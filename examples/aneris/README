--------------------- FILES ---------------------

o The .prog contains the code synthesized from aneris' specification.

o The .emlc contains an example of a configuration file to run aneris.


--------------------- VERSIONS ---------------------

o aneris_nuprl_terms.prog is the default version

o aneris_nuprl_terms_no_mul.prog varies from the default version by
the fact that it does not use multiplication (in 2/3 which is the only
place where multiplication is used) but only addition.
